In this project, we made a genetic algorithm that you, the user, have the choice to choose and breed the finest snowflakes. This project
shows the art that can be made using just ones and zeros, representing the possibilities that computers can help human achieve. Before having this
final version for my genetic algorithm, I have to make a function called "breeding function" that essentially breeds 2 chosen parents and 
create a child that carry the traits of those parents, chosen randomly. Additionally, I also made a funcion called "roulette" that weight
the fitness value that the user input into the snowflakes and choose the best and strongest snowflakes for breeding. This project was made 
using Processing.
